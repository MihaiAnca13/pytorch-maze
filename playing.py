# initialize the maze with one cell chosen arbitrarily
# start at a new cell chosen arbitrarily
# perform a random walk until we reach a cell already in the maze
# if at any point the random walk reaches its own path, forming a loop, erase the loop from the path before proceeding
# When the path reaches the maze, we add it to the maze
# perform another loop-erased random walk from another arbitrary starting cell, repeating until all cells have been filled.
